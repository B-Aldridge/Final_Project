# Summary
For this project, we created multiple machine learning models for three projects:
1) Predicting which movie actor is most likely to say a particular quote
2) Predicting tumor pathology using brain MRI images
3) Predicting diseases based on patient symptomatology

Files/detailed readme files for each project are found in each respective directory.
