# Goal
For this project we will be creating a machine learning model that will analyze any given quote and give you the actor who most likely said the quote.

# Getting Started
To begin, we explored data from various sources and defined the scope of our project. We collected data from multiple different sources and uploaded it onto Jupyter Notebooks. This marked the starting point for our data preprocessing efforts. We dealt with multiple CSV files containing essential information. These files were merged based on common columns, and unnecessary columns were removed to ensure the data was adequately prepared for model training.
