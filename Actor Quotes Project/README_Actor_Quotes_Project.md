# Goal
For this project we will be creating a machine learning model that will analyze any given quote and give you the actor who most likely said the quote.

# Getting Started
To begin, we explored data from various sources and defined the scope of our project. We collected data from multiple different sources and uploaded it onto Jupyter Notebooks. This marked the starting point for our data preprocessing efforts. We dealt with multiple CSV files containing essential information. These files were merged based on common columns, and unnecessary columns were removed to ensure the data was adequately prepared for model training.

# Instructions for viewing files
The "actors and roles files" directory contains code used for cleaning the actors and movie roles dataset. The "LSTM model" directory contains the files used for creating the LSTM model. The "LSTM Model.ipynb" file creates the model, and exports the model and model variables. The "Actor Predictor.ipynb" file loads the model and variables, and runs a function that predicts a list of actor names based on input of a list of strings. "other model attempts and depricated files" directory contains many files used in the initial stages of the project, including other modeling attempts and other databases that were considered for this project.

Note: original IMDB database files used in creating the dataframe used in this project are too large to upload to GitHub, but a link to these is provided in the "actors and roles files" directory.
